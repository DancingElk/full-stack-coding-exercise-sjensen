## The Assignment

As the next step in the interview process, we invite you to complete a take-home coding exercise that
represents a common use case at Premise.

Premise collects images from all around the globe through our millions of worldwide contributors. On the frontend team,
one of our challenges is how best to display these images back to our customers, so they can ultimately derive insights and make important decisions.

One of the more common customer requests is to search through the images to display only those matching a common theme, geography, etc. 
While we aren't able to provide Premise images for this take-home exercise, we have found a proxy in the [Museum of Metropolitan Art's API](https://metmuseum.github.io/). With this exercise, we are
looking for you to build an application that provides a user-friendly way for a customer to search for:
+ a particular artist
+ art medium
+ department
+ or anything else of interest to you

### Basic Instructions

1. Clone this repo
1. Create a branch for your work
1. Commit as often as you'd like
1. Submit a Pull Request
1. Include any special instructions that might be useful to run the application

### Requirements

+ On the backend, implement an API endpoint to fetch data from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)

+ On the frontend, implement a React application to display some data from the API.

Feel free to use a component library of your choice.

You may use whatever libraries you like provided that their licenses permit their use in this scenario.

Feel free to use outside reference material (documentation, tutorials, etc), but all work must be your own.

We ask that you do not use a database, file storage, or anything that creates a separate process.

We also ask that you do not copy or distribute this exercise or your solution.

### Expectations

We don't have a time limit, but we expect it will take no more than 3-4 hours. We ask that you try to submit within 72 hours, but if life gets in the way and you need more time please let us know.

We want to stress that the time taken to complete the test will not impact your evaluation in any way. Again, we want to see you at your best. Once you have completed the exercise, your solution will be reviewed by an engineer with several criteria in mind:

1. Is the code easily understandable?
1. Does the code follow modern best practices?
1. Is the code written in such a way that it can be easily unit-tested?
1. Is the code readily open to extension?

We look forward to seeing your work!
